/*
    Execution starts at the top of main.
    main variable a is created and given value 5.
    main variable b is created and given value 6.
    Function add is called with argument values 5 and 6.
    add parameters x and y are created and initialized
	with values 5 and 6 respectively.
    The expression x + y is evaluated to produce the value 11.
    add copies the value 11 back to caller main.
    add parameters y and x are destroyed.
    main prints 11 to the console.
    main returns 0 to the operating system.
    main variables b and a are destroyed.
